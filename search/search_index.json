At the software level, within an operating system , a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service . A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number , known as the port number.

This means that with CLI you can do similar tasks with minimum resources. High Precision You can use a specific command to target specific destinations with ease. As long as you don\u2019t type the wrong command, it will work like a charm. Once you learn the basics, writing syntax is not as hard as you might think. Repetitive Tasks Friendly GUI has developed well over the years. But, the operating system may not give you all the menus and buttons to perform all tasks. One of the reasons is safety. This leaves you overwhelmed if you have to do repetitive tasks. For example, when you have to handle hundreds of files within a folder, CLI enables you to use a single command to do automate the repetition easily.

It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface.

This means that with CLI you can do similar tasks with minimum resources. High Precision You can use a specific command to target specific destinations with ease. As long as you don\u2019t type the wrong command, it will work like a charm. Once you learn the basics, writing syntax is not as hard as you might think. Repetitive Tasks Friendly GUI has developed well over the years. But, the operating system may not give you all the menus and buttons to perform all tasks. One of the reasons is safety. This leaves you overwhelmed if you have to do repetitive tasks. For example, when you have to handle hundreds of files within a folder, CLI enables you to use a single command to do automate the repetition easily. Powerful Most operating systems today prevent you from messing up the system\u2019s core process. Windows has system protection and MacOS has SIP (System Integrity Protection). You won\u2019t be able to perform certain tasks which are system protected.
